- ee4218_project contains the vivado project for this project

- ip_repo contains the customised IP that we implemented

- the different verilog files are the different attempts we made to achieve better timing, the final implementation is "parallel 16bit Q8.8.v"

- simulation.v is the testbench for the code, it is for simulation of Q10.10 format

- sdk code.c contains the c code that  runs on the arm processor on the zedboard

- ppt file self explainatory

- pdf file is the reference for choosing the sigmoid implementation, PLAN is chosen by comparing its accuracy and difficulty to other implementation methods.
