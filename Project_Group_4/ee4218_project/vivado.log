reset_run

Description: 
Reset an existing run

Syntax: 
reset_run  [-prev_step] [-from_step <arg>] [-quiet] [-verbose] <run>

Usage: 
  Name          Description
  -------------------------
  [-prev_step]  Reset last run step
  [-from_step]  First Step to reset
  [-quiet]      Ignore command errors
  [-verbose]    Suspend message limits during command execution
  <run>         Run to modify

Categories: 
Project

Description:

  Resets the specified run to an unimplemented or unsynthesized state. Use
  this command to reset the run to prepare it to be run again.

Arguments:

  -prev_step - (Optional) Reset an implementation run from the last step
  completed. This can be used to reset an implementation run that is only
  partially completed because it was launched with the launch_runs -to_step
  command.

  -from_step <arg> - (Optional) Reset an implementation run from a specified
  step. This lets you restart a run from the specified step using the
  launch_runs -next_step command. Valid step values include:

   *  opt_design - Optionally optimize the logical design to more efficiently
      use the target device resources.

   *  power_opt_design - Optionally optimize elements of the logic design to
      reduce power demands of the implemented FPGA.

   *  place_design - Place logic cells onto the target device. This is a
      required step.

   *  power_opt_design (Post-Place) - Optionally optimize power demands of
      the placed logic elements.

   *  phys_opt_design - Optionally optimize design timing by replicating
      drives of high-fanout nets to better distribute the loads.

   *  route_design - Route the connections of the design onto the target
      FPGA. This is a required step.

   *  write_bitstream - Generate a bitstream file for Xilinx device
      configuration. This is a required step.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <run> - (Required) The name of the run to reset.

Examples:

  The following example resets the implementation run:

    reset_run impl_1

  Note: The run directory and its contents will be removed from the hard disk
  since -noclean_dir is not specified.

  The following example resets the synthesis run, but disables the cleanup of
  the run directory:

    reset_run -noclean_dir synth_1

  In this example, because -noclean_dir is specified, the synth_1 run
  directory is not removed and a new run directory called synth_1_2 will be
  created when the run is launched.

reset_project

Description: 
Reset current project

Syntax: 
reset_project  [-exclude_runs] [-exclude_ips] [-exclude_sim_runs] [-quiet]
               [-verbose]

Usage: 
  Name                 Description
  --------------------------------
  [-exclude_runs]      Do not reset runs
  [-exclude_ips]       Do not reset ips
  [-exclude_sim_runs]  Do not reset simulation runs
  [-quiet]             Ignore command errors
  [-verbose]           Suspend message limits during command execution

Categories: 
Project

Description:

  Reset the current project to its starting condition, with source and
  constraint files, by cleaning out the various output files created during
  synthesis, simulation, implementation, and write_bitstream. Also resets the
  state of the project to the start of the design flow.

  Note: Any user-defined Tcl variables that are in the global namespace (i.e.
  not in a project-specific namespace) are not reset or cleared by this
  command. Global variables are persistent with the invocation of Vivado and
  are only cleared when the Vivado Design Suite is closed. You can also use
  the unset command to expressly clear a specific Tcl variable.

Arguments:

  -exclude_runs - (Optional) Exclude the <project>.runs folder from the reset
  process. In this case, the runs folder will be preserved, while the rest of
  the project data will be removed.

  -exclude_ips - (Optional) Exclude the <project>.srcs/sources_1/ip folder
  from the reset process. In this case, the IP folder, containing the IP
  cores and generated targets, will be preserved, while the rest of the
  project data will be removed.

  -exclude_sim_runs - (Optional) Exclude the <project>.sim folder from the
  reset process. In this case, the simulation folder will be preserved, while
  the rest of the project data will be removed.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Example:

  The following example resets the current project, while preserving the
  simulation run data, and returning all messages regardless of message
  limits:

    reset_project -exclude_sim_runs -verbose
